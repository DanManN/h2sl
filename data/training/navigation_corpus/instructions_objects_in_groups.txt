This document provides a list of instructions for the 'objects_in_group' dataset. The dataset is currently composed of two main parts:

1. objects_in_rows - this set of examples all have simple worlds with a single row of varying length composed of either cones or barrels, listed below:
  -three_cones
  -four_cones
  -five_cones
  -five_cones (actions)
  -three_barrels
  -four_barrels
  -five_barrels
  -five_barrels (actions)

2. objects_in_groups - this set of examples all have more complicated worlds with mutliple types of groups (rows/columns/rings/etc). The worlds each fall into a category of a general scene layout with variances in the concept parameters; the categories are listed below:
  -row_col_ring
  -row_col_group 


The rest of this document lists the instruction, example filename, and world filename for each of the world categories listed above.
