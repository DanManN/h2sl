This document provides a list of instructions for the 'objects_in_rows' sub-dataset. Here are the current six caregories:

-three_cones
-four_cones
-five_cones
-three_barrels
-four_barrels
-five_barrels

So, each scenario consists of a single row of objects in front of the robot. The differences across the scenarios are the number of objects in the row (3, 4, or 5) and the object_type (cone or barrel). 

The example files are named example_0000 - example_xxxx, so this document should help organize the examples by scenario while still making it convenient to train on all examples for a single model.
